- How ready i am to start new step in my  career's Path 

I’m extremely excited and ready to take the next step in my career. The bootcamp has equipped me with a solid foundation in Javascript software developement, and I feel confident in my ability to apply these skills in real-world projects. I’m eager to start contributing to a team and further develop my expertise.


- Thought about the skills you gain during the Bootcamp :

Throughout the bootcamp, I’ve gained proficiency in technologies such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB, along with a deep understanding of the full-stack development process. I’ve also developed important problem-solving skills through hands-on projects, which helped me learn how to troubleshoot issues efficiently and optimize code. Additionally, collaborating with peers on group projects has improved my communication and teamwork abilities, making me comfortable working in a collaborative environment.


I’m highly motivated to continue growing and applying the knowledge I gained. The bootcamp not only sharpened my technical skills but also strengthened my passion for coding and software development. I’m looking forward to using my newfound abilities to make meaningful contributions and further expand my knowledge through on-the-job learning.

THANK YOU GOMYCODE
